                Name - Shiro<br><br>
                Age - 1<br><br>
                Occupation - Superhero<br><br>
               
                Shiro (シロShiro), Lucky in the Vitello, Phuuz and Dutch dubs, and Whitey in the Funimation and LUK Internacional dubs,
                 is a white (Shiro means white) pup Shin-chan  found in a cardboard box in episode 7b (I found a Puppy). 
                 While he is a beloved member of the family, he is the subject of neglect thanks to his owner's forgetfulness
                  and short attention-span. He is a very intelligent dog, often presenting logic and intellect that surpasses his 
                  human owners. As his meals from the Noharas are at best inconsistent and at worst far-in-between, he has developed a 
                  venerable talent for foraging and scavenging to survive days without meals. An oddly human-like dog, he is very responsible 
                  and painstakingly careful. He saves the world under the superhero moniker of Super Shiro[1].
                He is very beloved to Shin-chan, but Shin-chan often teases, mocks and forgets him. His doghouse also often ends up becoming a 
                place for Shin-chan to hide himself or something he doesn't want his family to find.  </p>
