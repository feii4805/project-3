                Name - Nene Sakurada<br><br>
                Age - 5<br><br>
               Occupation - Kindergartner<br><br>
                
                Nene Sakurada (Neni) (桜田ネネ) (5 years old),  is one of Shin-chan's classmates and friends from the sunflower class. 
                She loves to play "real omamagoto" ("real house") in which divorces and arguments are very common and she typically 
                forces/blackmails the boys to play with her. She insists on being the mom all the time-and she forces her friends to
                 do stuff they don't really want to do. This is always a nuisance to Shin-chan, Bo-chan, and Kazama-kun and a nightmare 
                 to Masao as he often needs to be Nene's husband (as an unsuccessful salaryman) in the plot. She occasionally sees her mother
                  go crazy or do something out of character which shrieks Nene to say something literally translated to be "you're not my usual mom!".</p>
