                Name - Misae Nohara<br><br>
                Occupation - Housewife)<br><br>
                Age - 32 <br><br>
                
                Misae Nohara (née Koyama) (野原みさえ), Mitsy Nohara in the Vitello,
                 Phuuz and Dutch dubs, is the mother of the Nohara family, and its caretaker. 
                 She is 32 years old but she always tells people that she is 24 or 25. 
                 She is the classical housewife of post-war Japan - she cleans, launders, cooks,
                  sews, mothers, and lazes all to varying degrees of success. A paragon of hypocrisy, 
                  after handing out irrevocable edicts to her husband and children (mainly Shinnosuke), 
                  she will not hesitate to immediately break them once they are out of sight
                   and has even been known to display double standards while in their company.
