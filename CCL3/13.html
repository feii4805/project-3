                Name - Ume<br><br>
                Age - 24 <br><br>
                Occupation - Kindergarten teacher <br><br> 
               Ume Matsuzaka (松坂 梅), is the arch-rival of Midori Ishizaka of the Rose Class. She is 24 year old and single. She likes to live 
                stylishly in public but she actually struggles to save her money for accessories and lives in a very cheap, dusty apartment.
                 She dislikes her given name as she always says to Yoshinaga and others, "Don't call me Ume!". This is due to one of the meanings 
                 of "Ume", which can mean "3rd class" or "low class". Although she always says she is "tired of Futaba Kindergarten (especially 
                 Shin-chan and friends)" and plans to move out to a better school, she never seriously intends to do it. She even rejects a man 
                 so harshly who offers her a better job in another school and mocks Futaba Kindergarten. </p>
