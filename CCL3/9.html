               Toru Kazama (風間 徹 Tōru Kazama) (5 years old), Georgie in the English Funimation dub and Cosmo in the Vitello, 
               Phuuz and Dutch dubs, is Shin-chan's immaculately groomed friend and classmate from the sunflower class, who usually 
               loses his mind when Shin-chan tease him and other things. He also bickers with Shin Chan. Even though Kazama always 
               denied when Shin Chan says that he is his best friend, his best friend is Shin Chan too. Of all Shin's friends, he's 
               the only one referred to by his family name (Kazama-kun). Only his mother and father use his given name (Tōru-chan).
