                Name - Ai Suotome<br><br>
                Age - 5<br><br>
                Occupation - Kindergartner<br><br>
                Ai Suotome(酢乙女あい, Ai-chan) (5 years old), 
                She is born in New York and is from an extremely rich family. She happened to be enrolled into the Futaba
                 Kindergarten because she threw a dart at the map of Japan and hit Kasukabe, thereby determining where she 
                 would go next. She is always seen riding in a black limousine and with a bodyguard. She is very manipulative 
                 and purposely bends people to her will just because she can. For example, she made many boys at Futaba Kindergarten
                  fall in love with her. However, when she tried to do the same to Shin-chan, she failed. Because of that, she fell in 
                  love with Shin-chan and being the manipulator she is, uses his weaknesses (Action Mask, Chocobi, etc.) to get him to notice her.
