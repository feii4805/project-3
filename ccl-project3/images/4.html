                Name - Himawari Nohara<br><br>

               Himawari Nohara (野原ひまわり), Daisy Nohara in the Vitello, Phuuz and Dutch dubs, 
               is the youngest child of the Nohara family, born on September 27 of 1996 
               (the date of the special episode in which she was born). She is a precocious and 
               vibrant infant. While technically newborn, her character has matured and grown more 
               intelligent during her stay in the series. She possesses a palpable lust for shiny objects 
               (jewels and precious metals) and brand-name goods, being able to discern a real jewel 
               from a simple piece of imitation (and throwing away the latter). She can't talk.
                 She emulates her mother in her utterly stubborn pursuit of handsome young men who
                catch her eye, not unlike her older brother, who soon discovered that a way to pacify her
                 was to put on a cutout mask of a known handsome actor.</p>
