               Bo Suzuki (Bo-chan) (ボーちゃん) is one of Shin-chan's friends and classmates from the sunflower class,
                he is 5 years old. Sometimes he is called 'Bo-chan'. He seems slow and expressionless, but is actually 
                quite smart and has an interest in artistic, adult-oriented things. He loves to collect various kinds of stones, 
                and investigating urban legends and various mysterious objects such as UFOs. He has his own place where he says 
                the rarest stones in Japan can be found. He often surprises his friends with his insight, though he speaks quite slowly.
                 He always has a trail of mucus running down his nose and can perform various tricks with it. Bô-chan always volunteers 
                 for the role of pet dog or cat when the group plays house. After the nursery he likes to go to a Kasukabe store in which 
                 tatami is made, he loves to see how they do it.
