                Name - Nanako Oohara<br><br>
               Age - 20<br><br>

               Nanako Ohara (大原 ななこŌhara Nanako), Miss Bono in the Vitello, Phuuz and Dutch dubs, is the college girl 
               with whom Shin-chan is in love. She first appeared in episode 175a "My True Love" (オラの本気の恋だゾ). The first 
               time they met was when Shin-chan was strolling in the neighborhood and got something in his eye. Nanako took it 
               out for him. Since then, they have kept in contact. Nanako is the only girl that is unruffled by Shin-chan's behavior,
                and the only one Shin-chan tries to behave for, even being shy and blushing around her. She dreams of being a kindergarten teacher.
