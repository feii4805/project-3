              Hiroshi Nohara (野原ひろし) (35 years old), Harry Nohara in the Vitello, 
                Phuuz and Dutch dubs, is the father of the Nohara family, and its sole source of income as he works 
                at as kakarichô (a low-level manager) at Futaba Shoji where he does overtime to earn a little more money
                 and because of the 32-year mortgage he still has to pay. Quite surprisingly he still manages to have time 
                 to spend with his family. Hiroshi met Misae Koyama when he was 29 and married her soon after. Soon, they had Shinnosuke.

                He is a loving father to his two children, and ultimately a devoted husband.
